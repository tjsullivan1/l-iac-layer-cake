This is a starter repository for my infrastructure-as-code documentation. 

There are three steps to getting up and running.

1. Bootstrap your infrastructure as code practice by deploying an Azure Container Registry with a bicep template.
2. Make that bicep template a module, and create a github action workflow to automate the versioning of the module in Azure Container Registry.
3. Fully automate the deployment of live infrastructure based on that template.

Each of these steps is broken into its own folder with a readme that contains more infromation.
